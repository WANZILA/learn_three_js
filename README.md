# 🧪 3D Shapes Playground — Learning Three.js

Welcome to my **Three.js playground**!  
This is a personal project where I'm learning 3D web development from the ground up — by getting my hands dirty, building cool stuff, and having fun along the way.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To understand the fundamentals of **Three.js** by:
-Primitives (cube, sphere, plane)
-Mesh
-lights
-camera(perspective, orthographic, depth of field, apeture)
-materials
-textures
-Scenegraph
-Shadows
-Fog
-Render Targets
-Custom BufferGeometry
-to understand is UV maps, it combines textures and materials to paint the mesh, this is the technique used in all video games
-and so much more
-the basics of this will translate to all game engines, Unreal, Unity, everywhere.  Three.js is only a render engine so it lacks a lot of 
 the nifty tools of the other game engines., but it is super lightweight and unbelievably powerful.  It gives us the full power of the GPU 
 through javascript and a web browser

## 📚 How to Run

1. Clone or download the repo
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Play around, explore the code, and tweak things!

## 🌱 Why I’m Doing This

> “You don’t learn to swim by reading about it. You learn by jumping in.”

This is my way of jumping into the deep end of 3D graphics. I’ll keep evolving this playground as I experiment and grow. If you’re also learning, feel free to fork it and build your own!

## 🧠 Lessons So Far

- Three.js is powerful but needs practice
- Everything is just geometry, material, and light
- The scene/camera/renderer loop is the core of it all
